This course covers an array of SQL-related topics, such as retrieving, updating and filtering data; functions and subqueries; creating & updating tables; & many more! 



## Basic Concepts 

### 1.1 Lesson: Introduction to Databases 

#### Welcome to SQL

A database is a collection of data that is organized in a manner that facilitates ease of access, as well as efficient management and updating.

A database is made up of tables that store relevant information.

For example, you would use a database, if you were to create a website like YouTube, which contains a lot of information like videos, usernames, passwords, comments.
