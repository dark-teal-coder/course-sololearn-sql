SELECT ProductName, ProductionDate, ExpirationDate 
FROM Products;

/* 
EXPLANATION:

We only have to select 3 columns from the table with 4 columns so we cannot use * in this case. 

SQL is case-insensitive by default so we can write table and column names in PascalCase, all uppercase or lowercase, or mixed case as long as there is no special character in between.
