    "\n",
    "#### Welcome to SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** is a collection of data that is organized in a manner that facilitates ease of access, as well as efficient management and updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is made up of tables that store relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you would use a database, if you were to create a website like YouTube, which contains a lot of information like videos, usernames, passwords, comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/1060-01-01-p01-a.png\" alt=\"./images/1060-01-01-p01-a.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> :warning: In this course we will learn how to create and query databases using SQL!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "A **table** stores and displays data in a structured format consisting of columns and rows that are similar to those seen in Excel spreadsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases often contain multiple tables, each designed for a specific purpose. For example, imagine creating a database table of names and telephone numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we would set up columns with the titles *FirstName*, *LastName* and *TelephoneNumber*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table includes its own set of fields, based on the data it will store.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/1060-01-01-p02-a.png\" alt=\"./images/1060-01-01-p02-a.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> :warning: A table has a specified number of columns but can have any number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a field in the table that uniquely identifies the table records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary key's main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It must contain a **unique value** for each row.\n",
    "- It cannot contain **NULL** values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, our table contains a record for each name in a phone book. The unique **ID** number would be a good choice for a primary key in the table, as there is always the chance for more than one person to have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/1060-01-01-p03-a.png\" alt=\"./images/1060-01-01-p03-a.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> :warning:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Tables are limited to ONE primary key each.\n",
    "> - The primary key's value must be different for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand what a database is, understanding SQL is easy. **SQL** stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL** is used to access and manipulate a **database**.\n",
    "**MySQL** is a **program** that understands **SQL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- insert, update, or delete records in a database.\n",
    "- create new databases, tables, stored procedures and views.\n",
    "- retrieve data from a database, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> :warning:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, but there are different versions of the SQL language.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Most SQL database programs have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard, but all of them support the major commands.\n",

    "### 2.1 Lesson: SQL Statements: SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic SQL Commands 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL ```SHOW``` statement displays information contained in the database and its tables. This helpful tool lets you keep track of your database contents and remind yourself about the structure of your tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the ```SHOW DATABASES``` command lists the databases managed by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SHOW DATABASES\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial we will be using the MySQL engine and the PHPMyAdmin tool to run SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> :warning: The easiest way to get MySQL and PHPMyAdmin is to install free tools like XAMPP or WAMP, which include all necessary installers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic SQL Commands 2\n",

    "The ```SHOW TABLES``` command is used to display all of the tables in the currently selected MySQL database.\n",

    "A **query** may retrieve information from selected columns or from all columns in the table.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> In this tutorial, we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is case **insensitive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following statements are equivalent and will produce the same result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "select City from customers;\n",
    "SELECT City FROM customers;\n",

    "> :warning: It is common practice to write all SQL commands in **upper-case**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "A single SQL statement can be placed on one or more text lines. In addition, multiple SQL statements can be combined on a single text line.\n",
    "\n",
    "White spaces and multiple lines are ignored in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following query is absolutely correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT        City\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM customers;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is recommended to avoid unnecessary white spaces and lines.\n",

    "### 5.1 Lesson: DISTINCT and LIMIT\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The DISTINCT Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations in which you have multiple duplicate records in a table, it might make more sense to return only unique records, instead of fetching the duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL ```DISTINCT``` keyword is used in conjunction with SELECT to eliminate all duplicate records and return only unique ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of DISTINCT is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT column_name1, column_name2\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
    "```\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> :warning: The DISTINCT keyword only fetches the unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The LIMIT Keyword 1\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, all results that satisfy the conditions specified in the SQL statement are returned. However, sometimes we need to retrieve just a subset of records. In MySQL, this is accomplished by using the LIMIT keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for LIMIT is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column_list\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "LIMIT [number of records];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can retrieve the first five records from the customers table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City\n",
    "FROM customers LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> :warning: By default, all results that satisfy the conditions specified in the SQL statement are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The LIMIT Keyword 2\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pick up a set of records from a particular offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we pick up four records, starting from the third position:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, City\n",
    "FROM customers OFFSET 3 LIMIT 4;\n",
    "```\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> :warning: The reason that it produces results starting from ID number four, and not three, is that MySQL starts counting from zero, meaning that the offset of the first row is 0, not 1.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Practice: Customer Copies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The DISTINCT Keyword\n",

    "- PRIMARY KEY - Enforces the table to accept unique data for a specific column and this constraint create a unique index for accessing the table faster.\n",
    "- CHECK - Determines whether the value is valid or not from a logical expression.\n",
    "- DEFAULT - While inserting data into a table, if no value is supplied to a column, then the column gets the value set as DEFAULT.\n",

    "In SQL, a VIEW is a virtual table that is based on the result-set of an SQL statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Views allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structure data in a way that users or classes of users find natural or intuitive.\n",
    "- Restrict access to the data in such a way that a user can see and (sometimes) modify exactly what they need and no more.\n",
