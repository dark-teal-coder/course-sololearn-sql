SELECT DISTINCT Checks 
FROM Operation; 

/* 
EXPLANATION:

Only the "checks" column is expected. We do not have to include the "id" column. So we cannot use * in this case. 

SQL is case-insensitive by default so we can write table and column names in PascalCase, all uppercase or lowercase, or mixed case as long as there is no special character in between.
